Hi Everyone, Thank you for viewing our project! 
This is the project we am submitting to the 2021 Chainlink Hackathon!
It currently only works on the Rikeby testnet

# NFTemperature uses Chainlink VRF to mint an NFT with random stats and a random image. 

Through the help of the many resources that Chainlink provided, we were able to code our own NFT generator using Solidity and the Truffle Suite. 

# We used OneClickDapp to create the front end to the project

Here is the link: https://oneclickdapp.com/watch-poker

# Etherscan

# It has been deployed to OpenSea

# All images have been pinned on IPFS and Pinata

Here are some of the NFT images:
